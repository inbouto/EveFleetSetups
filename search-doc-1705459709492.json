Wait at least a couple days before you make more. If certain BPOs prove to be quite popular we may add duplicates to the library to increase capacity. There is one general &quot;public&quot; can that anyone can deliver to for those who don't copy enough to warrant their own personal can. However, regular BPO copiers are encouraged to contact someone in staff and have a can assigned to them. Regular members cannot remove the cans or edit their configuration. Please deliver your BPCs directly to the can with your name on it if you have one. When finished, the copy will be locked. Only you, or whomever you give permission, can unlock and retrieve the BPC. Before setting up your copy job, please double and triple check that you are delivering to the correct station can. If you deliver to the general corp hangar, it will not be locked and we will be unable to assist you should it be taken by someone else. Do not take other's BPCs, obviously. All BPCs are auto-locked upon entry into the cans. When a BPC is unlocked the person who unlocked it is entered into the can's audit log. All members have access to these audit logs for transparency. If you unlock a BPC belonging to someone else and the BPC is reported missing, it will be assumed you took it. If you find your BPC missing, report it to staff and do not take matters into your own hands. We will handle it professionally and discretely. You may deliver another person's job when it is completed. But you may not collect that BPC. It's assumed they assigned the job to deliver to the right can and that everyone will respect the fact only the job initiator is allowed to retrieve the resulting BPC. This is to keep the BPOs circulating instead of waiting for the individual who started it to press the button.

The rats may turn out to be extremely challenging foes, depending on the kind of site that's being prospected. This means the fleet commander needs to know ahead of times which ore or gas sites they can clear with their fleet's firepower.     It is also worth noting that some gas sites do not require their rats to be cleared, as techniques like &quot;Chameleon huffing&quot;, &quot;Jedi huffing&quot; and &quot;Sonic huffing&quot; can be used to huff around the rats.

The Motorcade​  Used during : mining phase, retrieval phase Comprised of : head scout, tail scout     This formation is designed to avoid any ship getting &quot;stuck&quot; in J-space after a split by always having probing-capable ships on both sides of the split. To this effect, the motorcade should be headed by the head scout, followed by the payload, and end with the tail scout. The royal convoy should fly at the end of the payload, right before the tail scout.     The name &quot;Motorcade&quot; is inspired by the U.S.A's presidential motorcade  The Swarm​  Used during : mining-phase Comprised of : simple miner, mining support, taxi The swarm is the group of mining ships that will sit on the ore or gas site, tasked with depleting it as quickly as possible. Most of the time, the swarm will be comprised of elusive mining ships like Ventures, Prospects, Endurances, as well as ships fitted with mining foreman bursts, such as a Porpoise or a Gnosis. While it is possible to use mining barges and exhusmers for the swarm, this is generally not recommended since elusiveness is usually the best defense strategy for temporary wormhole operations.  The Royal Convoy​  Used during : mining-phase, retrieval phase Comprised of : main hauler, the royal guard The Royal Convoy is a small but tight formation for the main hauler. Its goal is to ensure the main hauler always has an exit route, no matter what happens. When flying through wormholes, it is important that the royal guard always goes first, it case the wormhole would collapse under the main hauler's mass alone.  The Ratters​  Used during : ratting phase Comprised of : ratter The Ratters are tasked with clearing rats off a site to then allow the swarm to safely mine the ore.

Fits  Head Scout​  The head scout is the head of the motorcade. It is the first ship to jump into a wormhole. For this reason, it is the most at risk of being killed by a wormhole camp. The many risks include (but are not limited to):  Interdiction spheresSmart bombsStealth bombersStrategic cruisers (very popular in J-space) For this reason, the head scout should always be comprised of a covert ops ship, fitted with a covert ops cloak, an interdiction nullifier, as well as a warp core stabilizer, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness. For the sake of keeping the fleet flexible in case of a split or other emergency, it is also desirable for the head scout to be holding a mobile depot, for instance allowing mining ships to fit a probe launcher and serve as a makeshift tail scout. Please note that while the head scout is a probing ship, the systems they will venture into should already have been probed down. The head scout should already have access to safe spot and entry and exit wormhole locations, and should not have to scan wormhole signatures during normal operations.  Fits  Tail Scout​  The tail scout is the last ship of the motorcade. Similar to the head scout, it is tasked with finding a new way out in case of a split. After a split, the tail scout should assume the role of head scout for the group that is left behind. For this reason, while the tail scouts are not in as much immediate danger as the head scout during normal operations, it should still be similarly fitted with a covert ops cloak, an interdiction nullifier, as well as a warp core stabilizer, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness.

Rats will always spawn at the site's warp point, so during the 15-25 minutes rats timer, go to the farthest edge of the largest cloud from the warp point (that is usually upwards).

If you're too close to them, you'll still have time to escape. Watch them after they warp in, and leave if they all start flying towards you.
