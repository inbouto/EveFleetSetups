Once an interesting site is found, a probing squad member is tasked with warping over to the site, and using a survey scanner to identify the remaining resources on-site. If the site is brand new, that will trigger the rats spawn timer, which will require moving to the (ratting phase) Eventually, an ore or gas site is selected, and with a proper &quot;breadcrumb trail&quot; (a chain of bookmarked wormholes), the ratting phase can begin.

The rats may turn out to be extremely challenging foes, depending on the kind of site that's being prospected. This means the fleet commander needs to know ahead of times which ore or gas sites they can clear with their fleet's firepower.     It is also worth noting that some gas sites do not require their rats to be cleared, as techniques like &quot;Chameleon huffing&quot;, &quot;Jedi huffing&quot; and &quot;Sonic huffing&quot; can be used to huff around the rats.

The Motorcade​  Used during : mining phase, retrieval phase Comprised of : head scout, tail scout     This formation is designed to avoid any ship getting &quot;stuck&quot; in J-space after a split by always having probing-capable ships on both sides of the split. To this effect, the motorcade should be headed by the head scout, followed by the payload, and end with the tail scout. The royal convoy should fly at the end of the payload, right before the tail scout.     The name &quot;Motorcade&quot; is inspired by the U.S.A's presidential motorcade  The Swarm​  Used during : mining-phase Comprised of : simple miner, mining support, taxi The swarm is the group of mining ships that will sit on the ore or gas site, tasked with depleting it as quickly as possible. Most of the time, the swarm will be comprised of elusive mining ships like Ventures, Prospects, Endurances, as well as ships fitted with mining foreman bursts, such as a Porpoise or a Gnosis. While it is possible to use mining barges and exhusmers for the swarm, this is generally not recommended since elusiveness is usually the best defense strategy for temporary wormhole operations.  The Royal Convoy​  Used during : mining-phase, retrieval phase Comprised of : main hauler, the royal guard The Royal Convoy is a small but tight formation for the main hauler. Its goal is to ensure the main hauler always has an exit route, no matter what happens. When flying through wormholes, it is important that the royal guard always goes first, it case the wormhole would collapse under the main hauler's mass alone.  The Ratters​  Used during : ratting phase Comprised of : ratter The Ratters are tasked with clearing rats off a site to then allow the swarm to safely mine the ore.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Roles​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Wormhole mining fleet","url":"/EveFleetSetups/docs/fleets/Wormhole-mining#roles","content":" The Royal Guard​  The &quot;Royal Guard&quot; is another probing ship that should always directly precede the main hauler through wormholes.  Fits  Head Scout​  The head scout is the head of the motorcade. It is the first ship to jump into a wormhole. For this reason, it is the most at risk of being killed by a wormhole camp. The many risks include (but are not limited to):  Interdiction spheresSmart bombsStealth bombersStrategic cruisers (very popular in J-space) For this reason, the head scout should always be comprised of a covert ops ship, fitted with a covert ops cloak, an interdiction nullifier, as well as a warp core stabilizer, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness. For the sake of keeping the fleet flexible in case of a split or other emergency, it is also desirable for the head scout to be holding a mobile depot, for instance allowing mining ships to fit a probe launcher and serve as a makeshift tail scout. Please note that while the head scout is a probing ship, the systems they will venture into should already have been probed down. The head scout should already have access to safe spot and entry and exit wormhole locations, and should not have to scan wormhole signatures during normal operations.  Fits  Tail Scout​  The tail scout is the last ship of the motorcade. Similar to the head scout, it is tasked with finding a new way out in case of a split. After a split, the tail scout should assume the role of head scout for the group that is left behind. For this reason, while the tail scouts are not in as much immediate danger as the head scout during normal operations, it should still be similarly fitted with a covert ops cloak, an interdiction nullifier, as well as a warp core stabilizer, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness.
