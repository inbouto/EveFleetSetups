# Wormhole mining fleet

Mining in a wormhole is a high-risk high-reward operation. It involves a lot of planning, complex roles and constant attention from all party members, no AFK mining here.<br>
Fleet Commanders should be familliar with the different kinds of ore and gas sites that can be found in a wormhole, especially regarding the different sets of rats that they can spawn, and balance their combat ships accordingly.<br>
For gas sites specifically, it is also adviseable to be knowledgeable on different gas huffing techniques, like "Ninja huffing", "Chameleon huffing", "Jedi huffing" and "Sonic huffing" as well as which sites they are applicable to (TODO : guide on all these)

## Glossary
"*Wormhole*": the anomaly that can be probed down which leads to a new system
"*K-Space*": "normal" space, which includes all of high-sec, low-sec and nullsec.
"*J-Space*": sometimes called "wormhole" space. Includes all systems only accessible through wormholes.

A "Wormhole" describes the connection between J-Space systems, not the systems themselves. Fleet commanders are invited to enforce strict nomenclature to avoid confusion for fleet members.

## Planning

The plan of this operation is split into 3 phases (as well as general preparations) :
- **[preparations](#Preparations)**
- **[probing](#Probing-phase)**
- **[mining](#Mining-phase)**
- **[retrieval](#Retrieval-phase)**

<details id="preparations">
  <summary>Preparations</summary>
A starting high sec system must be selected, from which wormhole exploration will begin. This system should have the following features :
- Be relatively close to a trade hub, refinery, or other station where the expedition's loot should be retrieved
- Be as quiet as possible. Less activity in the system means fewer people entering that wormhole, which will attract fewer gankers from high-sec

Speed is the name of the game, as Wormholes can collapse behind your entire fleet without warning (for instance in case some wormhole corporation decided to roll a wormhole, to reach more loot). <br>
There should be as little delay as possible between the probing and retrieval phases to avoid getting trapped in J-space.

### Probing phase
A probing squad goes into the chosen starting wormhole and start probing down signatures. These ships can later transition into different roles during the **[mining](#Mining-phase)** and **[retrieval](#Retrieval-phase)** phases.<br>
Wormholes (and possibly gas site) signatures are then saved in a shared location folder accessible by all fleet members.<br>
Eventually, an ore or gas site is selected, and with a proper "breadcrumb trail" (a chain of bookmarked wormholes), the **[mining phase](#Mining-phase)** can begin.

### Mining phase
After selecting an ore or gas site the ["*Motorcade*"](#The_Motorcade) can start making its way to the mining site.<br>
Once on the chosen site, mining ships can start mining the ore or gas. Depending on the specific fleet setup, compression may be available on-site, and mining ships may have to haul their ore to the fleet hauler themselves.<br>
Once the Fleet Commander calls to retreat, the [motorcade](#The_Motorcade) will escort the mining ships out, leaving the fleet hauler (and possibly Porpoise or Orca) behind.<br>
The [retrieval phase](#Retrieval-phase) can then begin.

### Retrieval phase
The [motorcade](#The_Motorcade) will make its way back to the Hauler to escort it out of J-space. Once in high-sec, ore and gas can be brought to designated retrieval station.

## Fleet Setups

## Fleet Roles

### The Royal Guard


### The Motorcade
This formation is designed to avoid any ship getting "stuck" in J-space. This can happen when a wormhole collapses while the fleet is in-transit, stranding some fleet members on one side or another of the wormhole.<br>
For this reason, the motorcade should be headed and trailed by dedicated probing ships.<br>
<br>
The name "*Motorcade*" is inspired by the U.S.A's [presidential motorcade](https://youtu.be/88vmzn_LufA)

#### The Vanguard
The vanguard is the head of the motorcade. It is the first section to jump into a wormhole. For this reason, it is most at risk of being killed by a wormhole camp.<br>
The many risks include (but are not limited to):
- Interdiction spheres
- Smart bombs
- Stealth bombers
- Strategic cruisers (very popular in J-space)

For this reason, the vanguard should always be comprised of a covert ops ship, fitted both with a **covert ops cloak**, an **interdiction nullifier**, as well as a **warp core stabilizer**, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness.<br>
For the sake of keeping the fleet flexible in case of an emergency, it is also desirable for the vanguard to be holding a **mobile depot**, for instance allowing mining ships to fit a probe launcher and serve as a makeshift [rearguard](#the-rearguard).<br>
Please note that while the vanguard is a probing ship, the systems it will venture into should already have been probed down. The vanguard should already have access to safe spot and entry and exit wormhole locations, and should not have to scan wormhole signatures during normal operations.

#### The Payload
This section is whatever ships are currently being escorted by the motorcade. They usually don't have a role within the motorcade, but can sometimes be retro-fitted to support the motorcade in case of a [split](#split).

#### The Rearguard
Similar to [the vanguard](#the-vanguard), the rearguard is tasked with finding a new way out in case of a [split](#split).<br>
After a [split](#split), the rearguard should assume the role of vanguard for the group that is left behind.<br>
For this reason, while the rearguard is not in as much immediate danger as [the vanguard](#the-vanguard) during normal operations, it should still be similarily fitted with a **covert ops cloak**, an **interdiction nullifier**, as well as a **warp core stabilizer**, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness.
