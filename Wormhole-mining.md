# Wormhole mining fleet

Mining in a wormhole is a high-risk high-reward operation. It involves a lot of planning, complex roles and constant attention from all party members, no AFK mining here.<br>
Fleet Commanders should be familiar with the different kinds of ore and gas sites that can be found in a wormhole, especially regarding the different sets of rats that they can spawn, and balance their combat ships accordingly.<br>
For gas sites specifically, it is also advisable to be knowledgeable on different gas huffing techniques, like "Ninja huffing", "Chameleon huffing", "Jedi huffing" and "Sonic huffing" as well as which sites they are applicable to (TODO : guide on all these)<br>
It is also imperative that all fleet members be deeply familiar with the different phases of operations, as well as fleet formations and setups.

## Glossary
"*Wormhole*": the anomaly that can be probed down which leads to a new system
"*K-Space*": "normal" space, which includes all of high-sec, low-sec and nullsec.
"*J-Space*": sometimes called "wormhole" space. Includes all systems only accessible through wormholes.

A "Wormhole" describes the connection between J-Space systems, not the systems themselves. Fleet commanders are invited to enforce strict nomenclature to avoid confusion for fleet members.

## Planning

The plan of this operation is split into 4 phases (as well as general preparations) :
- **[preparations](#Preparations)**
- **[probing](#Probing-phase)**
- **[ratting](#ratting-phase)**
- **[mining](#Mining-phase)**
- **[retrieval](#Retrieval-phase)**

### Preparations
A starting high sec system must be selected, from which wormhole exploration will begin. This system should have the following features :
- Be relatively close to a trade hub, refinery, or other station where the expedition's loot should be retrieved
- Be as quiet as possible. Less activity in the system means fewer people entering that wormhole, which will attract fewer gankers from high-sec

Speed is the name of the game, as Wormholes can collapse behind your entire fleet without warning (for instance in case some wormhole corporation decided to roll a wormhole, to reach more loot). <br>
There should be as little delay as possible between the probing and retrieval phases to avoid getting trapped in J-space.

### Probing phase
Formations used : [Probing squad](#probing-squad)<br>
A probing squad goes into the chosen starting wormhole and start probing down signatures. These ships can later transition into different roles during the **[mining](#Mining-phase)** and **[retrieval](#Retrieval-phase)** phases.<br>
Wormholes (and possibly gas site) signatures are then saved in a shared location folder accessible by all fleet members.<br>
Once an interesting site is found, a probing squad member is tasked with warping over to the site, and using a **survey scanner** to identify the remaining resources on-site.<br>
If the site is brand new, that will trigger the rats spawn timer, which will require moving to the (ratting phase)
Eventually, an ore or gas site is selected, and with a proper "breadcrumb trail" (a chain of bookmarked wormholes), the [ratting phase](#ratting-phase) can begin.

### Ratting phase
Formations used : [The Motorcade](#the-motorcade), [ratters](#ratters)<br>
Rats will spawn a few minutes on ore or gas sites after a player ship first warps into it. This means a prospected site will be in one of 3 states :
- Brand new, rats not yet triggered, but will be coming in 15-20 minutes
- Rats already triggered and present on-site
- Rats already triggered, but already cleared

In the first 2 cases, a squad of combat PvE ships needs to be sent in to clear the sleepers. The rats may turn out to be extremely challenging foes, depending on the kind of site that's being prospected. [This means the fleet commander needs to know ahead of times which ore or gas sites they can clear with their fleet's firepower](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_sites#Ore_sites).<br>
<br>
It is also worth noting that some gas sites do not require their rats to be cleared, as techniques like "Chameleon huffing", "Jedi huffing" and "Sonic huffing" can be used to huff around the rats.

### Mining phase
Formations used : [The Motorcade](#the-motorcade), [the swarm](#the-swarm)<br>
After selecting an ore or gas site the ["*Motorcade*"](#The_Motorcade) can start escorting [the swarm](#the-swarm) to the mining site.<br>
Once on the chosen site, the swarm the ore or gas. Depending on the specific swarm setup, compression may be available on-site, and mining ships may have to haul their ore to the fleet hauler themselves.<br>
Once the Fleet Commander calls to retreat, the [motorcade](#The_Motorcade) will escort the swarm out, leaving the [main hauler](#main-hauler) and its [royal guard](#royal-guard) behind.<br>
The [retrieval phase](#Retrieval-phase) can then begin.


### Retrieval phase
The [motorcade](#The_Motorcade) will make its way back to the [main hauler](#main-hauler) to escort it out of J-space. Once in high-sec, ore and gas can be brought to designated retrieval station.

## Fleet Setups

### Formations

#### The Motorcade
Used during : [mining phase](#mining-phase), [retrieval phase](#retrieval-phase)<br>
<br>
This formation is designed to avoid any ship getting "stuck" in J-space after a [split](#split) by always having probing-capable ships on both sides of a split.<br>
To this effect, the motorcade should be headed by the [head scout](#head-scout), followed by the payload, and end with the [trail scout](#trail-scout).<br>
The [main hauler](#main-hauler) should fly at the end of the payload, right before the tail scout, and **ALWAYS** be preceeded by the [royal guard](#royal-guard)<br>
<br>
The name "*Motorcade*" is inspired by the U.S.A's [presidential motorcade](https://youtu.be/88vmzn_LufA)

#### The Swarm
Used during : [mining-phase](#mining-phase)<br>
The swarm is the group of mining ships that will sit on the ore or gas site, tasked with depleting it as quickly as possible. Most of the time, the swarm will be comprised of elusive mining ships like Ventures, Prospects, Endurances, as well as ships fitted with mining foreman bursts, such as a Porpoise or a Gnosis.<br>
While it is possible to use mining barges and exhusmers for the swarm, that is generally not recommended since elusiveness is usually the best defense strategy for

### Roles

#### The Royal Guard
The "[Royal Guard](https://youtu.be/PhrB0TZdQqE)" is another probing ship that should always directly precede the [main hauler](#main-hauler).

#### Head Scout
The head scout is the head of [the motorcade](#the-motorcade). It is the first ship to jump into a wormhole. For this reason, it is the most at risk of being killed by a wormhole camp.<br>
The many risks include (but are not limited to):
- Interdiction spheres
- Smart bombs
- Stealth bombers
- Strategic cruisers (very popular in J-space)
For this reason, the head scout should always be comprised of a covert ops ship, fitted with a **covert ops cloak**, an **interdiction nullifier**, as well as a **warp core stabilizer**, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness.<br>
For the sake of keeping the fleet flexible in case of a [split](#split) or other emergency, it is also desirable for the head scout to be holding a **mobile depot**, for instance allowing mining ships to fit a probe launcher and serve as a makeshift [tail scout](#tail-scout).<br>
Please note that while the head scout is a probing ship, the systems they will venture into should already have been probed down. The head scout should already have access to safe spot and entry and exit wormhole locations, and should not have to scan wormhole signatures during normal operations.

#### Tail Scout
The tail scout is the last ship of [the motorcade](#the-motorcade). Similar to [the head scout](#head-scout), it is tasked with finding a new way out in case of a [split](#split).<br>
After a split, the tail scout should assume the role of head scout for the group that is left behind.<br>
For this reason, while the tail scouts are not in as much immediate danger as the head scout during normal operations, it should still be similarly fitted with a **covert ops cloak**, an **interdiction nullifier**, as well as a **warp core stabilizer**, and maximizing align time and general elusiveness.

#### Prober
