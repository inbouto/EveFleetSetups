"Chameleon" huffing is the practice of huffing a gas cloud until it is depleted while staying out of **aggro** range of the rats (much larger than their targetting range).

The term was (to my knowledge) coined by [Wadd Enderas in this video](https://youtu.be/JOKZ1N-miIk).

## Requirements

### Sites
Only the following sites can be "Chameleon huffed"
- Ordinary (Requires a very specific setup, **DO NOT WARP TO THAT SITE BEFORE READING [ORDINARY SITE SETUP](#Ordinary-site-setup)**
- Bountiful
- Vital
- Instrumental

:::note
At the time of writing, I am unsure whether Vast sites can be chameleon-huffed. If you find out, please let me know, and I'll refund your Venture if you lost it as a result ðŸ˜›

### Ships
All ships and all fits can chameleon-huff

## How to
Chameleon-huffing is all about finding a spot that's inside (or near) the **largest cloud of the site** but outside of the rats' arrgo range.
:::note
At the time of writing, I am unsure what the rats' aggro range is exactly. It is at least 240km, and may vary per-site.
:::
Rats will **always spawn at the site's warp point**, so during the 15-25 minutes rats timer, go to the farthest edge of the largest cloud from the warp point (that is usually upwards).

Once you've put several hundreds of kms between you and the warp point, you should be safe from the rats' aggro.

:::warning
Pay attention to the rats. If you're too close to them, you'll still have time to escape. Watch them after they warp in, and leave if they all start flying towards you.
:::

Once in a safe huffing spot outside of the rats' aggro range, **bookmark it** so you can warp back to it later without grabbing the rats' aggro.

## Ordinary site setup

The [Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ordinary_Perimeter_Reservoir) is a peculiar one, since the rats' sentries are already present before anyone warps to the site.

However, they will not target capsules, and cannot target "above" themselves.

This means you can still huff the entire "top" cloud by doing the following :
- At your safe, exit your Venture and warp to the site in your capsule so the sentries do not target you.
  - if you're flying a Prospect instead, or any covert ops ship, you can warp in at 100 while cloaked instead.
- Bookmark the location of the "top" cloud (that is, the one above the sentries)
- Warp back to your safe and enter your Venture
- Warp to the bookmarked "top" cloud
