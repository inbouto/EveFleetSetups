"Ninja huffing" simply refers to the idea of huffing as much gas as possible off a cloud before the rats spawn. This is very easy to do, since the rats spawn at a very predictable interval.

The term "ninja huffing" comes from the old MMO concept of "ninja looting".

## How to

Whenever a player first warps to a site (gas site, ore belts, etc), a timer is triggered, at the end of which rats will spawn.

For Wormhole gas sites, that timer is anywhere between 15 and up to 25 minutes. To effectively Ninja huff, simply set a timer (on your phone for example) of 15 minutes right as you warp in. When it rings, keep an eye out for the rats, and be ready to warp out to your safe.

Note that you should always be paying attention to your dscan and be ready to warp out at any time regardless of rats timer.

### What to do if the rats don't spawn after 25-30 minutes ?

This means someone else warped to the site and the rats have already been cleared out. After 30 minutes without rats, you can be confident no further rats will spawn.

## Requirements

### Sites

All sites can be ninja-huffed

### Ships

All ships and fits can ninja-huff
