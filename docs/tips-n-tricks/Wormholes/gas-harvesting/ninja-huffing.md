"Ninja huffing" simply refers to the idea of huffing as much gas as possible off a cloud before the rats spawn. This is very easy to do, since the rats spawn at a very predictable interval.

The term "ninja huffing" comes from the old MMO concept of "ninja looting".

## Requirements

### Sites

Only one site cannot be ninja-huffed : the [Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ordinary_Perimeter_Reservoir).
:::warning
**DO NOT WARP TO THE ORDINARY SITE**. It is **NOT SAFE**. Rats (sentries) are already on site before anyone warps in, and will **ONESHOT YOUR VENTURE**. That site can still however be [chameleon huffed](./chameleon-huffing#ordinary-site-setup)
:::

### Ships

All ships and fits can ninja-huff, as it requires no specific gear.

## How to

Whenever a player first warps to a site (gas site, ore belts, etc) **and is uncloaked**, a timer is triggered, at the end of which rats will spawn.

For Wormhole gas sites, that timer is anywhere between 15 and up to 25 minutes. To effectively Ninja huff, simply set a timer (on your phone for example) of 15 minutes right as you warp in. When it rings, keep an eye out for the rats, and be ready to warp out to your safe.

Note that you should always be paying attention to your dscan and be ready to warp out at any time regardless of rats timer. Core/Sisters Probes are cause for concern, but not a sure sign - if you see another T1 Explorer on Dscan it is less likely to be cause for alarm. Combat scanner probes, however, are valid reason to Cloak and warp to a Safe. If you have no cloak, pingponging on various astral bodies and your safe can help deter any would-be attacker. Be cautious about warping to your exit hole (you did plan your quick exit, right?) immediately when a threat is spotted, as they may be cloaked on the hole, waiting to bump you off.

### What to do if the rats don't spawn after 25-30 minutes ?

This means someone else warped to the site and the rats have already been cleared out. After 30 minutes without rats, you can be confident no further rats will spawn.
