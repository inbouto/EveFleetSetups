"Jedi" huffing consists of reducing our huffing ship's signature radius to significantly reduce the damage done by rats, to then use a small shield booster to regenerate the shield.

This works because of how [missiles apply damage based on signature radius](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile_mechanics#Missile_damage_formula).

## Requirements

### Sites
The following sites can be Jedi huffed :
- Instrumental
- Minor

### Ships
This technique is only possible with a Prospect, as its signature radius gets smaller the higher your expedition frigate level is.

Ideal speed (with AB active) should be 1200m/s. It's important not to go too fast.

:::note
It is apparently possible to use this technique with a **Gnosis**, but I haven't seen much information on that exact subject.

### Skills
Expedition Frigate: 3 (lowers the Prospect's signature radius)

## How to
On the suitable sites, the goal is to orbit the largest cloud in a way where you won't directly fly into the rats. This means you may have to re-orbit the site several times to get a good orbit, depending on the site.

Instrumental sites require a horizontal orbit.

Minor reservoirs can have any orbit.

The exact setup does not matter much, so long as you end up orbiting the largest cloud and kiting the rats.

:::warning
Never warp at 0 on a cloud that could have rats on it.
