Harvesting gas clouds (sometimes called "Huffing") in wormhole space can be very dangerous and require a lot of preparation, but is also often very profitable and accessible to new players, including alpha clones, with very little skill investment.

## Requirements
- [Gas cloud harvesting skill](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Resource_Processing#Gas_Cloud_Harvesting) At level 2 for T1 gas scoops, and level 5 for T2 scoops (T2 have residue, T1s do not)
- A venture with a core probe launcher and 2 gas scoops (don't forget your 8 core probes ammunition minimum)
- A basic understanding of the [Directional scanner, or Dscan](https://youtu.be/56Yx7nDJlAM) and the [Probe scanner and probe launcher](https://youtu.be/VRNoyPMBcKU) (typically an exploration tool, but necessary to find wormholes and  gas sites as well as exploration sites)
- A basic understanding of [Wormholes and how to navigate them](https://youtu.be/KXchl0usz5M)
