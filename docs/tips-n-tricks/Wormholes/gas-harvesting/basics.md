:::note

This section will **NOT** be discussing K-space (high-sec, low-sec, null-sec) huffing. The actual mechanics of K-space clouds are vastly different.

:::

Harvesting gas clouds (sometimes called "Huffing") in wormhole space can be very dangerous and require a lot of preparation, but is also often very profitable and accessible to new players, including alpha clones, with very little skill investment.

## Requirements

- [Gas cloud harvesting skill](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Resource_Processing#Gas_Cloud_Harvesting) At level 2 for T1 gas scoops, and level 5 for T2 scoops (T2s have residue, T1s do not)
- A venture with a core probe launcher and 2 gas scoops (don't forget your 8 core probes ammunition minimum)
- A basic understanding of the [Directional scanner, or Dscan](https://youtu.be/56Yx7nDJlAM) and the [Probe scanner and probe launcher](https://youtu.be/VRNoyPMBcKU) (typically an exploration tool, but necessary to find wormholes and  gas sites as well as exploration sites)
- A basic understanding of [Wormholes and how to navigate them](https://youtu.be/KXchl0usz5M)

Notes :
- T1 gas scoops can be (and should be, for solo huffing) upgraded for T2 scoops. This requires Gas Harvesting V, and has a residue probability, so should not be used when huffing with a group.
- Mid slots are very flexilbe. Favor speed and elusiveness over tank. If you get caught, you die, just warp out ASAP.
- You can use a `Warp Core Stabilizer` in the low slot instead, but a lot of WH ganking ships have +5 or +6 warp scrambling strength. Just get out of there before they can lock you, don't hope they can't scram you.

## How to huff gas in wormhole space

Short version :
- Equip a probe launcher on your gas-fitted venture
- Use your probe scanner to find a suitable "entry" wormhole in K-space (usually high-sec)
- **Bookmark ALL your entry and exit wormholes, and bookmark safe spots for every J system you visit**
- Scan down signatures in the J systems you visit, until you find a gas cloud
- Find the most valuable cloud and start huffing
