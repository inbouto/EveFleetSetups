"Sonic" huffing means kiting the rats, staying outside of their range, while orbiting the largest cloud of the site.

:::note
The utility of this technique is close to none (does not enable huffing any cloud/site that other, simpler and more complete techniques do) and is only being documented for the sake of completeness.

:::note
This technique is most commonly known as "Jedi" huffing. However, there is [another technique also called "Jedi" huffing](./jedi-huffing) which involves tanking the rats by reducing your signature radius.

I am using a different term to have a clear distinction between the two techniques.
